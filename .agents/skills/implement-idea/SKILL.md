  Turns an unfiled idea into a confirmed mini-spec, implements and validates the
  selected approach, reviews it, and opens a draft pull request. Use when the

  Requires git and the GitHub CLI (gh) for the /create-pr handoff, plus network

# Implement idea

Turn the idea into a confirmed mini-spec, then deliver it end to end in the
current repository.

## Gates

- Start with a provisional mini-spec of at most 400 characters, including
  spaces. Confirm the final mini-spec covering the user-visible outcome,
  scope/non-goals, and verifiable success criteria only after the
  artifact-assisted grill.
- Read project instructions, vision, contribution guidance, Definition of Ready,
  Definition of Done, relevant domain skills, real project commands, affected
  code paths, tests, and related work before deciding.
- Always perform and record web search for current evidence before presenting
  options. Prefer official and primary sources, reconcile them with the versions
  in the checkout, and treat remembered links only as search leads. Stop if the
  search cannot produce current evidence relevant to the decision.
- When `grill-with-docs` or `grill-me` is registered, run its actual
  user-question loop before presenting options. Prefer `grill-with-docs`; if
  neither exists, note that once and continue.
- During the grill, proactively give the user visual or dynamic context selected
  by the affected surface:
  - for UI/UX, show upfront mockups for every materially different experience;
  - for architecture or workflows, show a diagram or flow;
  - for interaction-heavy or technical behavior, create a short-lived dynamic
    prototype for the recommendation or the interaction that cannot be judged
    statically.
  Show a shared current-state view when it helps compare options. Clearly label
  observed facts, proposed behavior, and prototype-only shortcuts.
- Keep prototypes local and disposable, retain only reviewable captures and
  findings, and remove them when the grill concludes. Do not deploy or publish
  them. Preserve or promote a prototype only with explicit user approval; keep
  approved prototype material outside the selected worktree until its
  `git-workflow` synchronization gate passes.
- Present two to four genuinely distinct evidence-backed options, recommend one,
  and wait for the user's choice unless automatic mode applies. Include a
  compact evidence digest with links to the most relevant current sources,
  checked project versions, and any mismatch or remaining uncertainty.
- For any code or test change, complete the project gate, one bounded
  `/code-review fix-all`, and `/create-pr`.

## Project definitions

Treat the nearest applicable `DEFINITION_OF_READY.md` and
`DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` as canonical. If either is absent after a real search,
state that once, carry the gap into the plan and PR, and use only the workflow's
built-in checks plus commands the repository actually declares.

## Automatic mode

Automatic mode applies only when the original prompt says `automatic` or
explicitly requests it. It does not waive web research, source and documentation
probing, surface-appropriate artifacts, mini-spec confirmation, or any other
gate. After presenting the evidence and options, select the evidence-backed
recommendation and continue. A material product, architecture, security, scope,
or vision decision disables automatic mode.

## Workflow

1. Draft the provisional mini-spec in at most 400 characters, including spaces.
   Treat it as a starting point, not a confirmed contract.
2. Load the applicable project contracts and specialized skills.
3. Find the existing implementation seam, reusable patterns, sibling features,
   tests, and architectural constraints. Always perform current web search and
   reconcile its results with the checkout. If the idea already exists,
   recommend using it; if partial, extend rather than duplicate it.
4. Produce the surface-appropriate artifacts, run the grill gate with that
   context, validate readiness, then confirm the final mini-spec and present the
   options and recommendation. Ground the checkpoint in evidence from this run.
5. After selection, reuse or create a focused branch/worktree and apply the
   `git-workflow` remote-default synchronization gate before editing.
6. Implement the smallest complete change at the correct layer. Update tests and
   docs required by the mini-spec and project contracts.
7. For UI/UX work, render every affected state; capture reviewable before/after
   evidence; check accessibility, responsive behavior, themes, and design-system
   consistency; attach the evidence to the PR.
8. Run targeted checks while developing, then the applicable Definition of Done
   and repository gate. Fix failures rather than weakening the gate.
9. Run one `/code-review fix-all` pass against the success criteria, Definition
   of Done, project conventions, branch diff, and reproducible behavior.
   Resolve every validated in-scope finding and rerun affected checks. Stop for
   a material new decision; do not continue with unresolved Blocking or
   Important findings. If `/code-review` is unavailable, perform that same
   bounded review and fix pass directly.
10. Use `/create-pr` and summarize the mini-spec, delivered outcome, and observed
    completion evidence in the PR.
